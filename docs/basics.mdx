## Tailwind Basics

Tailwind CSS works very differently from normal CSS and Instead of writing CSS files and class names, you style elements **directly in HTML** using small utility classes.

At first this looks messy, but it actually makes things faster and easier once you get used to it.

### Utility Classes

Each Tailwind class usually does **one thing**.

For example:

- `bg-blue-500` → background color  
- `text-white` → text color  
- `p-4` → padding  
- `rounded` → border radius  

You don’t create custom class names, just combine small classes to get the style you want.

### Why It's Useful

With normal CSS:

- You can easily jump between HTML and CSS files
- You create class names
- You forget what styles are applied

With Tailwind:

- Everything is visible in one place
- No naming problems
- Changes are so fast

### It Feels Weird

Seeing many classes on one element looks ugly at first, But after some practice, your brain starts reading them like a sentence, And you stop fighting CSS.
