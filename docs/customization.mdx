## Customization
- The core tailwind : 
* **Don’t fight the defaults**
* **Extend instead of replacing**
* **Keep everything in the config**
I'd mention that, One of the best things about Tailwind is that you can **change it to fit your project**, and you don’t have to use the default colors, fonts, or spacing forever, cause Tailwind is made to be customized.

### The Config File

All customization happens in one place:

**`tailwind.config.js`**

This file actually tells Tailwind that : 
- where your files are
- what colors, fonts, and sizes to use
- which plugins are enabled

And A very basic config looks like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
````
Most of the time, you only touch `theme.extend`.

### Adding Your Own Colors

Instead of replacing Tailwind’s colors, you usually **extend** them.

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brand: "#1E40AF",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Now you can use that : 

```html
<div class="bg-brand text-white p-4">
  Brand color box
</div>
```

---
### Custom Fonts

You can also add your own fonts:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ["Inter", "system-ui", "sans-serif"],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Then use it normally:

```html
<p class="font-sans">
  This uses the custom font
</p>
```

---
### Changing Spacing

If the default spacing isn’t enough, you can add more:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      spacing: {
        128: "32rem",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Usage:

```html
<div class="p-128">
  Big padding
</div>
```

---

### Plugins

Tailwind has official plugins that save time.

For example:

```js
plugins: [
  require("@tailwindcss/forms"),
  require("@tailwindcss/typography"),
]
```

**As i told before**, it might feel kinda wierd, but once your config is set, writing UI becomes much faster and more consistent.
