# Components

Components are just pieces of your website that you can reuse, like buttons, cards, forms, or navbars. The cool thing about Tailwind is that you don’t have to write a lot of CSS to make them look nice, just put together utility classes in your HTML and boom—you have a component.

### For example, a button can be made like this:
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
  Click me
</button>

And if you use it a lot, you can even make a class with @apply so you don’t have to write all the utilities every time.

You can also use ready-made libraries built for Tailwind as i mentioned before in References : [my cool site][http://localhost:3000/docs/responsive-design]
