# Cards in Tailwind
Cards are boxes that hold information like text, images, buttons, or anything, and they are really useful for showing content in a clean and organized way. Tailwind makes it super easy to style them with shadows, rounded corners, and so on .

### Basic idea:
Use a div with bg-white for background, Add rounded for corners and shadow for a little depth, then Use p-4 or p-6 for padding inside.

### Example:

<div class="bg-white rounded shadow p-6">
  <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Card Title</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-600">some text inside.</p>
</div>

Or even You can also add:

Images: img at the top with w-full and h-48 object-cover

Buttons: inside the card with bg-blue-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded

Hover effects: hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow to make it interactive

Layouts: you can use flex for horizontal cards or grid for a grid of cards
