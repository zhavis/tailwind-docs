## Installation
Before using Tailwind, you need to **add it to your project**,
There are a few ways to do this, but most of the time you’ll use **npm**, and once installed, you’re ready to start using Tailwind.

### Using npm (Recommended)
This is the normal way for real projects.

First of all, create a project and initialize npm:

```bash
npm init -y
````
After that, install Tailwind and its helpers:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```
then create the configuration files:
```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
It gives you:
* `tailwind.config.js`
* `postcss.config.js`
---
### Tell Tailwind Where Your Files Are
Open `tailwind.config.js` and add your file paths,this lets Tailwind remove unused styles.:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
---
### Add Tailwind to CSS
Create a CSS file (for example `src/styles.css`) and add this,that’s all Tailwind needs:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
---
### Using CDN (Quick)
If you just want to **try Tailwind quickly**, you can use its CDN,this is fine for demos, but **not good for real projects**:
```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
---
### Frameworks
Tailwind works great with frameworks like these,and the setup is almost the same, you just import the CSS once:
* Next.js
* React
* Vue
