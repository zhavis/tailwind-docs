## Responsive Design

Tailwind is **mobile-first**.  
Styles work for mobile by default, and you add breakpoints for bigger screens.

### Breakpoints
these are useful standard sizes in this framework :
- `sm:` 640px
- `md:` 768px
- `lg:` 1024px
- `xl:` 1280px

### Example
This is a simple responsive layout. On mobile, the boxes stack vertically, and on medium screens and above, they sit side by side.

```html
<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
  <div class="w-full md:w-1/2">One</div>
  <div class="w-full md:w-1/2">Two</div>
</div>
